# Ant-Foraging

This program uses Agent-Based modeling to simulate Ant Foraging. The application includes a Qt graphical user interface, scientific visualization, and complex algorithms and algorithm conversion. 

In the model, ants begin at the colony and randomly search for food. They deposit a pheromone trail behind them at all times that either leads to food or back to the colony. While ants are searching for either the colony or food, if a desired pheromone trail is found in front of them, it will orient towards the strongest scent. In this way ants are able to make their own decisions and explore the world around them to find food and deposit it back at the colony.

The application also utilizes a rigorous series of Unit Tests developed through G-Code.
